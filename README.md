##For users
Google Chrome Extension to track how much you use the internet

Download from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wheres-the-cheese/imgocdfblfikpclhdddnnpcogmndegog)

Have you ever wondered how far your computer mouse has traveled over the years?  He sure is a trooper.  He spends all day jumping from link to link, confined within the hellish cage that is your computer screen, and for what?  Where's the cheese he deserves?  This extension may not give him the cheese, but it can at least let him track his progress.

Where's the Cheese? is an extension for tracking the distance your mouse has travelled.  It currently keeps track of daily and cumulative movement, and even gives you progress updates along the way.  If you share even an ounce of empathy for your poor little mouse it would be a sin not to download this.  Do it for Jeremy.
